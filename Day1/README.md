# WebDevelopment Basics

### What is web development?
Web development is a blanket term for everything that has to do with building a website. It encompasses markup, coding, scripting, network configuration, CMS development, eCommerce development, and all other related development tasks. Everything that is accessible in your browser is a product of web development.

### Web Basics
Before you can develop a simple blog or a business website, you need to understand how websites work. Basically, a website is a set of files stored on a server and accessed by a client using a browser such as Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. There are two key terms here that you should know how to distinguish: server and client.

### Client vs. Server
The server is a computer that hosts or stores files for websites. Countless servers are connected to each other in a massive network we commonly call the Internet. The client is a computer used to access websites. The computer you are using right now to read this article is a client. Data moves back and forth from servers to clients when we use the web.

### Front end vs. Back end
Web development is divided into two broad categories based on the client-server relationship—front end development and back-end development. Front end or client-side development focuses on the user interface or what you see on the browser when you use the Internet. Back-end or server-side development focuses on what happens in the background. To non-developers, the back end seems like a random series of letters, numbers, and symbols but it carries the digital infrastructure that makes a website run smoothly.

If your website were a brick-and-mortar shop, the front end would be the store front and product display area where customers look at the products and make their purchases. The back end would be the stock room and back office where products are delivered, stored, and inventoried.

### Code Editors
A code editor is a tool used by web developers to write and edit code. An essential tool for building websites, it has specialized functionalities that simplify the code editing process. A more advanced and robust tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) which combines different development tools to make coding much easier.

The most used code editors today include Visual Studio, Atom, Sublime Text, and Vim. For beginners, you can check out VS Code which is a lightweight version of Microsoft’s main IDE, Visual Studio. VS Code is easy to use and has customizable features that make it great for beginners.

## Front end Development
Front end, client-side, user-facing—these are the most common terms that refer to front end development. This type of web development deals with the visual aspects of a website from text and graphics to layout and navigation. If you were to become a front end developer, your main goal is to design and develop user interfaces that are aligned with the goals of your clients.

### Front end Development

#### Main File Types
Front end Development - Main File Types
1. HTML
As the main file type loaded in browsers, HyperText Markup Language (HTML) serves as the foundation of all websites. It defines the structure of a website regardless of how simple or complex the site is. It uses tags to indicate how text, images, and other content should be displayed. You can create a simple static website with HTML alone.

2. CSS
To enhance the visual appeal of a website, developers often use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) along with HTML. CSS is a coding language for styling and customizing web pages. You can use it to add custom fonts and colors, change the layout, and improve the aesthetics of your site.

#### 3. JavaScript
To make a website more dynamic, you need JavaScript. This programming language adds interactive elements that respond to user inputs such as click buttons and search queries. It becomes crucial when user engagement is important to meet the goals of the website. 

## Introduction

JavaScript is one of the most used languages when it comes to building web applications as it allows developers to wrap HTML and CSS code in it to make web apps interactive. It enables the interaction of users with the web application. It is also used for making animations on websites and has a large community on GitHub. JavaScript has tons of libraries, one of which is React, Express, next

Client-side scripting
Client-side scripting is when the server sends the code along with the HTML web page to the client. The script is referred to by the code.

In other words, client-side scripting is a method for browsers to run scripts without having to connect to a server.

The code runs on the client’s computer’s browser either while the web page is loading or after it has finished loading.

Client-side scripting is mostly used for dynamic user interface components including pull-down menus, navigation tools, animation buttons, and data validation.

It is currently quickly expanding and evolving on a daily basis. As a result, creating client-side web programming has become easier and faster, lowering server demand.

By far the most popular client-side scripting languages or web scripting languages, JavaScript and jQuery are frequently utilized to construct dynamic and responsive webpages and websites.

The browser downloads the code to the local machine (temporarily) and begins processing it without the server. As a result, client-side scripting is browser-specific.
